<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<div align="center">

  </a>
  </div>

This project covers the code for the Jarvis Winder, which is a machine for winding filaments used for 3D-printing. The winder is used to wind freshly extruded filament on spools and rewind filament from one spool to another. The machine can be controlled via [Webinterface](https://github.com/QiTech-Industries/WinderWebInterface), which can be accessed with mobile devices, too. The winder can either log into an existing wifi or create its own on the fly.

### Built With

Currently the following libraries are in use:

| Library           | Info                                                 | License |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| ArduinoJson       | https://arduinojson.org/                             | MIT     |
| Timer             | https://github.com/brunocalou/Timer                  | MIT     |
| ESPAsyncWebServer | https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer       | GNU-2.1 |
| LittleFS          | https://github.com/lorol/LittleFS.git                | GPL-2.0 |
| HardwareControl   | https://github.com/QiTech-Industries/HardwareControl | GPL-3.0 |

And the following main hardware components:
- Nema 17 (17HS19-2004S1)
- Nema 17 Planetary 1:5.18 (17HS19-1684S-PG5)
- TMC2130
- ESPduino (ESP32WROOM32)
- CNC Shield

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Usage
To get a local copy flashed to the machine run these simple steps.

1. Download the latest firmware-full.bin file from the releases section.
2. Use the ESP Web flashing tool: https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/ (recent Chrome or Edge Version)
  - install correct drivers so the ESP is recognized by the PC 
  - select baude 115200 and click connect
  - grant access to the serial port your esp is connected to
  - set "flash address" to 0x0 and upload firmware-full.bin
  - click the program button
  - once finished press the reset button on the esp once and you should be all set ready to go üèéÔ∏è

### Installation

These steps are only required if you want to develop the library. In case you just want to use it in one of your projects refer to [Usage](#usage)

1. Install the PlatformIO extension in VsCode `platformio.platformio-ide`
2. Install the C++ extension in VsCode `ms-vscode.cpptools`
3. Install ESP32 drivers (depending on the USB-UART Chip)
     - CP210 https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
     - CH341 http://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH341SER_EXE.html
4. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/QiTech-Industries/Winder.git
   ```
5. Install the project dependencies
   ```sh
   cd Winder && pio pkg install
   ```
   When using Windows you need to add `pio` to your path first or use the full path `C:\Users\<username>\.platformio\penv\Scripts\platformio.exe`
6. Upload the code and open Serial Monitor
   ```sh
   pio run --target upload --target monitor --environment src
   ```
   Alternatively you can use `PlatformIO->src->Upload and Monitor` in the left Sidebar

## Common Issues
- Imported files are not recognized (Intellisense Index build fails)
  - delete .pio folder
  - delete launch.json and s_cpp_properties.json in .vscode folder
  - `STRG + SHIFT + P` Rebuild Intellisense Index

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
This project should slowly adapt to the new Winder versions. This means apart from the WS interface there will also be a Serial interface implemented and an option for DC Motor control as well as the possibility of multiple hardware versions.

For the coming releases a new code structure is planned to make the code more modular and object oriented. Some refactored classes and a glimpse of the new code organization can be found in the [big-refactoring](https://github.com/QiTech-Industries/Winder/tree/big-refactoring) branch that will slowly get merged into main.

Apart from that all upcoming features are created and discussed as issues first.
See [open issues](https://github.com/QiTech-Industries/Winder/issues) for a full list. This is the most up to date roadmap you can get. Feel free to report new issues or fix existing ones.
