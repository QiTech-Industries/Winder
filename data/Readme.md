This directory is intended for files that need to be stored inside the ESP Flash

You can put files in here manually and use the PIO `Build Filesystem Image` or `Upload Filesystem Image` to write them into storage.

However the newest webinterface build will be merged in here automatically inside the build pipeline. The directory must always stay available and is intended to not be filled with files other than this Readme.
